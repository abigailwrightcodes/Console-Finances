# Console-Finances

## Description
JavaScript code to analyze records to calculate:
Total Number of months included in dataset
Net total Profit/ Loss over the period
The average of the changes in Profit/Loss over entire period
The greatest increase in profits over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses over the entire period

## Difficulties

I was able to calculate the change in profit and loss over the entire period but could not work out how to add those values together and divide by the amount of months.
I kept creating infinate loops and crashing my computer :(
I spent a lot of time focused in on this one issue and ran out of time to cover the rest of the project.

In future i will reach out for help on the problems i cannot find solutions for. 
I will continue to research and try to update with a solution as soon as possible.
